# silly discord bot
this is my silly discord bot <sub><sup>(that is made with ai)</sup></sub> that i've decided to open source! its very silly and pretty constantly updated


## What to do with the code
you can do whatever you want with it, though i don't think theres many uses, just reading the discord.js docs would be better, i just chose to open source it so anyone that needs it can use it

## I WANT THIS!
Currently, the bot is only in one server, i plan on making it public VERY soon, but theres some stuff to get figured out with the permissions (though i think normal "member" permissions for most servers will do)
